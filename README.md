# Direct Client SDK Examples

This repository contains all SDK examples for the [Ingenico Direct JavaScript Client SDK](https://support.direct.ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/mobile/javascript/).
Refer to the README in each folder for more details about that specific example.

## Full vs. minimal

Full examples offer a fully working payment flow that mimics all the functionality that the hosted payment pages offer.
The minimal examples show you how to include the SDK with a module loader.
